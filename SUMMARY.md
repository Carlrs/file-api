# Summary

## Comments

I enjoyed the assignment and appreciated the fact that there's both a
skeleton project and a relatively clear description of goals provided.

## Which part of the assignment took the most time and why?
I was stuck on the file download bit for a while, until I realized that I
needed to use the repository with String for ID instead of Int... Kept trying
to use custom queries until then, but Mongo didn't like me accessing the _id field directly.
However, that was a minor hurdle, just took
a bit of time to realize. The actual most time consuming part was the OpenAPI
documentation. Errors were cryptic and the documentation for OpenAPI
wasn't all that helpful for the general structure.
## What You learned

I learned the basics about Spring - first time using it, I've only used KTor
before (and I created my own lightweight ORM when I used KTor, as it
was not for an actual product and didn't need to be reliable).

## TODOs

Separate file content from metadata object in order to simplify
uploading and meta generation.

Add tests.

Hopefully I'll get around to those things before anyone sees this :)
